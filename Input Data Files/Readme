This is common in academic and planning studies, but in practice:

PV generation is not controllable (unless you curtail it, which is rare for small systems).
Consumer demand is not controllable (unless you have demand response).
Grid import/export is a result of the above and the battery's operation.
So, if you want the model to reflect a real system where only the battery is controllable, you would:

Set PV to consumer as min(PV, demand).
Set PV to grid as max(PV - demand, 0) if battery is full or not charging.
Set grid to consumer as max(demand - PV - BESS discharge, 0).
Only optimize the BESS charge/discharge.
